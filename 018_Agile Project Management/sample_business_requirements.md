## Executive Summary
Here at woz u exter lms we will be talking about business objectives, the scope of the project, and the functional requirments along with personal requirments 


*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*

## Business Objectives
This project is important to me because it will connect with like-minded students for projects, and the ecpectations for the students will to help learn more about coding and the goals of this project is to help students understand how to code and to help other students that struggle with some of the lessons 


*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project int he sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*

## Background
this project is being initiated because i feel like it is going to boost the economy and with technology changing, there is going to be a high demand for developers

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*

## Scope
the scope of this project is to provide the students with a breakdown of the diffrent computer languages what is not included in this project is slack 


*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

## Functional requirements
The student will go through several modulesthrough the course and they will connect with other students through slack and be able to help each other 


*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements
the personnel we will need to be sucessfull is mentors learning viedos and examples and a great developing team and they will be required to maintain good posture.

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule
on exter i want to see if the expections are being met by the excutive programer and so on down the ladder


*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements
you can use your mobile phone and use chrome as the browser support

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions
we will be using AWS frame work
*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations
the terms of time is long and personnel will have a large amount of people

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks
the risk of this project is that it could crash, it also could devlop 
and i could lose everything i worked for 
*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
